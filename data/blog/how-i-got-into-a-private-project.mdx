## So your wondering, how?

I showed my website to my tech teacher and he said, "How did you make it" So I pulled The Website  and the [blog.](https://kyletheduck.tk//blog/how-i-built-my-website)

So I wondered, there is this random software on my school laptop [Sphero EDU.](https://edu.sphero.com/)

# Looking up the API

When I looked up the Sphero API, it kinda seems easy. So when i started a program, I did need help.

# Under-Estimated

So I made the program, But I called my dad and it was easy for him.

# Will update soon!
